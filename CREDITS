I've had some more time to experiment and talk to linux-usb guys.
I did find a way to make the device not freeze so badly it'll stop
being usable, at least most of the time.

In cdc_acm.c
disabling the bailout in acm_tty_open:
>         if (0 > acm_set_control(acm, acm->ctrlout =3D ACM_CTRL_DTR | ACM_=
CTRL_RTS) &&
>            (acm->ctrl_caps & USB_CDC_CAP_LINE))
>                 goto full_bailout;

and acm_set_control in acm_port_down:
> acm_set_control(acm, acm->ctrlout =3D 0);

This has an unwanted effect though of not "resetting"/"stopping"
incoming bytes while there are no readers, and that when you connect a
reader(minicom, cat, whichever) you get up to 250-ish bytes suddenly.
(my guess is that it's because the driver isn't polling during that
time)

Anyone wanting to get his hands a little dirty to fix that is
welcome:)
